# Intraocular Bacillus genomic pipeline  
## Pipeline summary  
The Intraocular Bacillus genomic pipeline generates, for each sample:

1. Examining	quality	of reads
2. De novo sequence assemble
3. Assembly evaluate
4. Genome annotation
5. Phylogenetic and clustering analysis
6. The pan genome analysis

This document also describes the generation of the reference files required for each pipeline component.
