##This repository contains analysis pipelines for:

RNA-seq alignment, quantification, and quality control
eQTL mapping and annotation
Allele-specific expression quantification
Generation of the collapsed annotation used for gene-level expression quantification

A detailed description of the RNA-seq pipeline settings used for TOPMed is provided in TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline.md.
